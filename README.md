## Overview 
The Interdepartmental Cooperation Platform (ICP) is a digital solution designed to improve communication, coordination, and resource management among various government departments at the city level. It addresses the common issue of miscommunication and redundancy in projects such as public infrastructure maintenance, where multiple departments often need to work together. ICP enables seamless data exchange, task scheduling, and collaborative project management to ensure that different departments work in harmony, ultimately saving resources and reducing project delays.

## Key Features

Data and Resource Sharing: Departments can share critical data, like the status of pipelines or road repairs, allowing others to plan around these projects efficiently. Task Scheduling and Coordination: The platform offers a task scheduler that helps departments allocate tasks, set deadlines, and monitor progress, making cross-department coordination smoother. AI-Powered Chatbot: An integrated chatbot assists officials by providing information on ongoing and upcoming projects, displaying available resources, and facilitating quick task scheduling. Discussion Forums: Allows department representatives to discuss project details, share updates, and resolve issues in real-time, reducing the need for lengthy inter-departmental meetings. Scalability for Multiple Cities: Designed to accommodate various cities, enabling city-level officials across India to adopt the platform and adapt it to their specific needs. Technologies Used
